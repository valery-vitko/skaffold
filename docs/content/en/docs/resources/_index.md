## 2019 Roadmap

* Plugin model for builders
* IDE integration - VSCode and IntelliJ Skaffold dev/build/run/deploy support, Skaffold Config code completion
* Debugging JVM applications
* Provide help with integration testing
* Skaffold keeps track of what it built, for faster restarts
* Automated kubernetes manifest generation
* Pipeline CRD integration
* Infrastructure scaffolding for CI/CD on GCP/GKE
* Document end-to-end solutions
* Status dashboard for build (test) and deployment besides logging

The roadmap is subject to change and aspirational but we would like to share our plans with the user and contributor community.
