# Development

This doc explains the development workflow so you can get started
[contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to Skaffold!


## Requirements

You must install these tools:

1. [`go`](https://golang.org/doc/install): The language skaffold is
   built in (version >= go 1.11)
1. [`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/): For source control
1. [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep): For managing external Go
   dependencies. - Please Install dep v0.5.0 or greater.
1. [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): For building skaffold.
1. [`golangci-lint`](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint): You can use the
   helper [script](./hack/install_golint.sh) to get golangci-lint.

    ```shell
    ./hack/install_golint.sh
    ```

1. [`gocritic`](https://github.com/go-critic/go-critic): Go source code linter
   providing advanced checks currently missing from other linters.

## Getting started

First you will need to setup your GitHub account and create a fork:

1. Create [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
1. Setup [GitHub access via
   SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)
1. [Create and checkout a repo fork](#checkout-your-fork)

Once you have those, you can iterate on skaffold:

1. [Build your dev version of skaffold](#building-skaffold)
1. [Verify changes locally](#verifying-local-changes)
1. [Run skaffold tests](#testing-skaffold)
1. [Build docs](#building-skaffold-docs) if you are making doc changes

When you're ready, you can [create a PR](#creating-a-pr)!

You may also be interested in [contributing to the docs](#contributing-to-skaffold-docs).

## Checkout your fork

The Go tools require that you clone the repository to the `src/github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold` directory
in your [`GOPATH`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH).

To check out this repository:

1. Create your own [fork of this
  repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

1. Clone it to your machine:

   ```shell
   mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/GoogleContainerTools
   cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/GoogleContainerTools
   git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/skaffold.git
   cd skaffold
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:GoogleContainerTools/skaffold.git
   git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
   ```

   _Adding the `upstream` remote sets you up nicely for regularly [syncing your
   fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)._

## Making a config change

Some changes to the skaffold code require a change to the skaffold config. These changes require a few extra steps:

* Check to see what the latest config version was at the time of the last release. The easiest way to do this is to view the skaffold source on github at the last released tag.

* Check the current config version in the code. This can be found in `pkg/skaffold/schema/latest/config.go`: look for something like

```golang
const Version string = "skaffold/v1beta9"
```
* If the config versions are different, do nothing. Somebody has already bumped the config version for this release cycle.

* **If the config versions are the same**:

  * Run `./hack/new_version.sh` to freeze the current config version and cut a new version.

  * Commit these generated changes, and submit a PR.

Once you've done this, continue making your changes locally, including the new config change.
**Any new config changes belong in pkg/skaffold/schema/latest/config.go. Do not edit the older config versions.**

* Be sure and update the documentation in `pkg/skaffold/schema/<previous_config_version>/upgrade.go` with any additions, removals, or updates you make to the config.

* In case of backwards compatibility issues, update the `Upgrade()` method from the previous config version appropriately. This is usually required when a previously existing field in the config is changed, but **not** when a new field is added.

*Note: the Upgrade() method is called by skaffold automatically for older config versions. This can also be done manually by users by running `skaffold fix`.*

* Finally, before committing your final changes and opening your pull request, be sure and run `make test` locally. This will regenerate the JSON schemas for the skaffold config with your new changes. Commit the resulting changes autogenerated by the scripts.

## Building skaffold

To build with your local changes you have two options:

1. Build the skaffold binary:

   ```shell
   make
   ./out/skaffold version
   ```

   You can then run this binary directly, or copy/symlink it into your path.

1. Build and install the skaffold binary:

   ```shell
   make install
   skaffold version
   ```

   This will install skaffold via `go install` (note that if you have [manually downloaded
   and installed skaffold to `/usr/local/bin`](README.md#install), this is will probably
   take precedence in your path over your `$GOPATH/bin`).

   _If you are unsure if you are running a released or locally built version of skaffold, you
   can run `skaffold version` - output which includes `dirty` indicates you have built the
   binary locally._

## Verifying local changes

If you are iterating on skaffold and want to see your changes in action, you can:

1. [Build skaffold](#building-skaffold)
2. [Use the quickstart example](README.md#iterative-development)

## Testing skaffold

skaffold has both [unit tests](#unit-tests) and [integration tests](#integration-tests).

### Unit Tests

The unit tests live with the code they test and can be run with:

```shell
make test
```

_These tests will not run correctly unless you have [checked out your fork into your `$GOPATH`](#checkout-your-fork)._

In case you see go-critic tool error,

```shell
make test
RUN hack/linter.sh
ERRO Running error: no such linter "gocritic"
```

re-run the `hack/install_golint.sh` script to upgrade `golangci-lint`.

### Integration tests

The integration tests live in [`integration`](./integration) and run the [`examples`](./examples)
as tests. They can be run with:

```shell
make integration-test
```

_These tests require push access to a project in GCP, and so can only be run
by maintainers who have access. These tests will be kicked off by [reviewers](#reviews)
for submitted PRs._

### Running a subset of integration tests

You can select specific integration tests to run via the `INTEGRATION_TEST_ARGS` env var:

```shell
INTEGRATION_TEST_ARGS="-run=TestDev/" make integration-test
```

## Building skaffold docs

The latest version of the skaffold site is based on the Hugo theme of the github.com/google/docsy template.

### Testing docs locally

Before [creating a PR](#creating-a-pr) with doc changes, we recommend that you locally verify the
generated docs with:

```shell
make preview-docs
```
Once PRs with doc changes are merged, they will get automatically published to the docs
for the latest build to https://skaffold-latest.firebaseapp.com.
which at release time will be published with the latest release to https://skaffold.dev.

### Previewing the docs on the PR

Mark your PR with `docs-modifications` label. Our PR review process will answer in comments in ~5 minutes with the URL of your preview and will remove the label.

## Testing the Skaffold binary release process

Skaffold release process works with Google Cloud Build within our own project `k8s-skaffold` and the skaffold release bucket, `gs://skaffold`.

In order to be able to iterate/fix the release process you can pass in your own project and bucket as parameters to the build.

We continuously release **builds** under `gs://skaffold/builds`. This is done by triggering `cloudbuild.yaml` on every push to master.

To run a build on your own project:

```
gcloud builds submit --config deploy/cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions=_RELEASE_BUCKET=<personal-bucket>,COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) --project <personalproject>
```

We **release** stable versions under `gs://skaffold/releases`. This is done by triggering `cloudbuild-release.yaml` on every new tag in our Github repo.

To test a release on your own project:

```
gcloud builds submit --config deploy/cloudbuild-release.yaml --substitutions=_RELEASE_BUCKET=<personal-bucket>,TAG_NAME=testrelease_v1234 --project <personalproject>
```

Note: if gcloud submit fails with something similar to the error message below, run `dep ensure && dep prune` to remove the broken symlinks
```
ERROR: gcloud crashed (OSError): [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './vendor/github.com/karrick/godirwalk/testdata/symlinks/file-symlink'

```

To just run a release without Google Cloud Build only using your local Docker daemon, you can run:

```
make -j release GCP_PROJECT=<personalproject> RELEASE_BUCKET=<personal-bucket>
```

## Creating a PR

When you have changes you would like to propose to skaffold, you will need to:

1. Ensure the commit message(s) describe what issue you are fixing and how you are fixing it
   (include references to [issue numbers](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)
   if appropriate)
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

### Reviews

Each PR must be reviewed by a maintainer. This maintainer will add the `kokoro:run` label
to a PR to kick of [the integration tests](#integration-tests), which must pass for the PR
to be submitted.
